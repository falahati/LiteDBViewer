**LiteDB v5** contains an internal database browser and editor named [LiteDB Studio](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB#v5). 

Therefore, this project will not continue into version 5 of LiteDB and if you need a viewer for your database please consider using LiteDB Studio. 

At the time of writing this statement, LiteDB 5 is still in pre-release and LiteDB Studio won't open files created by LiteDB v4 or earlier; so this tool can be used for database files created by those versions.

LiteDB Viewer is a simple tool that let you open a LiteDB database file and view its contents.
